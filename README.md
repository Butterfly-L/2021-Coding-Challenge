# 2021-Coding-Challenge
I have attened the 2021 30-day Coding Challenge 

held by top IT media in Taiwan:[iThome](https://ithelp.ithome.com.tw/)
The rule is to publish one article per day for 30 days straight.

My topic is `Web Animation`
All my works are compiled with Gulp.
Check out [here](https://butterfly-l.github.io/2021-Coding-Challenge/)

## How to use this file
I use `gulp` to pack all my files.
Please `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
then `gulp run build` to see all the files.

# Cheers!
